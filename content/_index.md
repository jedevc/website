  Heya ðŸŽ‰ I'm Justin! I tend to go as @jedevc in most online places. If
  you've somehow ended up here, on the home page of my website, I hope you
  find what you're looking for? I guess? Definitely seems unlikely you'll
  find it here.

  I like doing bits and bobs of everything, from full-stack web development
  and systems programming, to hacking and learning (arguably) exotic
  programming languages.

  I'm currently a maintainer for [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit),
  and do various contributions around the container ecosystem from time to
  time ðŸ“¦
