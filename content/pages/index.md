      Heya ðŸŽ‰ I'm Justin! I tend to go as @jedevc in most online places. If
      you've somehow ended up here, on the home page of my website, I hope you
      find what you're looking for? I guess? Definitely seems unlikely you'll
      find it here.

      I like doing bits and bobs of everything, from full-stack web development
      and systems programming, to hacking and learning (arguably) exotic
      programming languages.

      I'm currently working at [Pexip](https://dev.pexip.com/), improving CI
      and fuzzing everything I can get my hands on.
